Components in the UI Kit ($lib/components) may have different variations e.g. default button, outline button, etc. To choose a particular variation, pass in the variation's class names via the "class" prop. Class names should be passed in a string, with each class name separated by a space character. Note: Do not include the customary "." (dot) at the start of the class name.
