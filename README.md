Components in the UI Kit ($lib/components) may have different variations e.g. default button, outline button, etc. To choose a particular variation, pass in the variation's class names via the "class" prop. Class names should be passed in a string, with each class name separated by a space character. Note: Do not include the customary "." (dot) class selector at the start of the class name.

Components may have different variations, or types. These types are created using CSS classes within the style block of the component. To be able to select a type of a component, the component exports a "type" prop. Pass the name of CSS class, for the type of component desired, through this prop.
